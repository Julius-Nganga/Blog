        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Uhuru Kenyatta, the former President of Kenya, has been a significant figure in Kenyan politics. He has been known for his efforts to promote national unity and development. However, his tenure was not as smooth as he hoped for when the political relationship between him and Ruto soured. He has been a vocal critic of the current regime, particularly regarding issues of governance and accountability. Kenyatta's commitment to addressing corruption and promoting social justice has made him a respected figure among many Kenyans. On the 25th June 2024 when the youths got to parliament in order to stop the financebill from passing Uhuru Kenyatta was the first to condemn Rutos regime for not listening to the people of Kenya and resulting in such a big mess the country had ever seen, he argued that the goverment should listen to the people and  on another instance told the youths to fight for their rights.</p>
